#### *EPITECH project by Micka DAOUD & Adrien LACHAMBRE*

## Project description:

The goal of the **my_navy** project is to create a battleship game in which two separated terminals communicate from one to another to exchange informations about the game such as the attack positions and if the attacks succeed or not.

## Project instructions:

You must code a terminal version of this game.
The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using the signals *SIGUSER1* and *SIGUSER2*.

The map size is 8x8. On each turn, you must display your positions, and then your enemy’s positions.

At the end of the game (when all the ships of a player have been hit), you must display whether “I won” (and return 0) or “Enemy won” (and return 1).
